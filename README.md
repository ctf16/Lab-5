This program takes the user's name as input. It then asks the user for a number x. 
The program prints out the user's name 'x' times, where x is an int. After each print, the program
appends '#x" to indicate how many times the name has been printed (which should be x times) 

Mark: My program takes the name as an input and their age. The system then prints out using the variables for age and name to say "<name> is <age> years old"
