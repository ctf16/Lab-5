        <h3>What it does</h3>

<p>This program acts as a way of storing data about one's family (or any group of people, for that matter). 
It takes an integer input for how many people will be entered into the makeshift 'database.' For each family member, the user will 
be prompted to enter a name, age and hobby. As each family member is added to the database, the program will reiterate it to the
user so the user can see what has been entered. </p>
        
        <h3>How you can use it</h3>

<p>Nothing needs to be imported to use this program. To use it, simply run it and follow the on-screen instructions. If the program prompts you to "please try again," you will need to run the program again from scratch (on JupyterLab, press Shift+Enter)</p>
